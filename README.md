# Parameterized-Vertex-Coloring
This is a Python implementation of the decision version of Vertex Coloring problem parameterized by vertex cover. The Vertex Coloring is an NP-Complete problem which is tractable when parameterized by it's own Vertex Cover.

# Problem Statement
- **Decision Version**: Given an unweighted, undirected graph **G(V, E)**, decide whether of set of vertices **V** has a proper colouring with at most *q* colours.
- **Optimization Version**: Given an unweighted, undirected graph **G(V, E)**, find the least number of colours for which the set of vertices **V** has a proper colouring i.e. find the chromatic number of the graph **G**.
